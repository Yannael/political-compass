# Political Compass

An open-source Python implementation of the renowned 4-quadrant political compass, written by [Justin Bodnar](https://justinbodnar.com) and inspired by the original concept from [politicalcompass.org](https://www.politicalcompass.org). Ideal for anyone looking to modify the existing quiz or create one of their own. This project allows users to take a quiz, analyze their results, and plot their political leanings on a two-axis graph.
